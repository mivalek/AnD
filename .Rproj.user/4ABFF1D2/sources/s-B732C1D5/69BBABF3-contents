## Overview

* The Story So Far
  + Distributions and test statistics
  + NHST and the null hypothesis
  + Predictors, outcomes, and types of data
* Today: the Linear Model
  + What is (statistical) modelling?
  + What is the Linear Model?
  + How do we use it, and why is it so important?

## The Story So Far

* Review of Milan's stuff

## The Story So Far: *r* and *t*



## Modelling a Line

* How can we learn about Y using X?
  + Statistical modeling
  + Outcome = Model + Error
* Brief revision: *r* and continuous data
* Creating a statistical model with lm()
  + Equation of the linear model
  + How does this equation create a line?
  + How is this line a model?
  + What does the linear model do?
* Looking ahead: the linear model forever
