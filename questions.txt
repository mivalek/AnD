01. Which symbol represents an estimates of a population parameter {03E}

- \hat{\sigma} (correct)
- \sigma
- \bar{x}
- \mu

02. What is the term for the number of observations per each value of a variable? {03M}

- Distribution (correct)
- Histogram
- Population
- Parameter

03. What is true with respect to the normal distribution?

- It is bell-shaped. (correct)
- It has a mean of 0.
- It has a variance of 1.
- Its shape changes based on degrees of freedom.

04. What is centring/centering?

- Changing the mean of a distribution by adding/subtracting a value from the entire variable (correct)
- Changing the variance of a distribution by adding/subtracting a value from the entire variable
- Changing the mean of a distribution by multiplying/dividing the entire variable by some value
- Changing the variance of a distribution by multiplying/dividing the entire variable by some value

What does scaling achieve?

- Changes the interpretation of the standard deviation (correct)
- Standardises a variable
- Changes the proportions of a variable
- Re-scales the location of the midpoint of a distribution 

What approximate proportion of the normal distribution lies between +- 1 SD from the mean?

[SAQ]

- 68% (correct)

What is wrong with the following definition of sampling distribution of the mean:
"Sampling distribution of the mean is the theoretical distribution of means of all possible samples of a given size taken from all populations."

- The samples must be taken from the same population. (correct)
- Nothing; the definition is correct.
- It is the empirical, not the theoretical distribution.
- It can be a distribution of any parameter, not just the mean.

What is the technical term for the standard deviationof the sampling distribution?

[SAQ]

- Standard error

Complete the formula for the estimate of standard error.

SE-hat = sd/sqrt(...)

As the sample size decreases, what happens to the standard error of a parameter?

- It increases. (correct)
- It decreses.
- It remains constant.
- It gets more precise.

In general, as standard error gets bigger, what happens to the parameter estimate?

- It gets less accurate. (correct)
- Its magnitde increases.
- Its magnitude decreases.
- It gets more accurate.

Select the properties of the sampling distribution of the mean.

[tick all]

- As sample size increases it tends to normal. (correct)
- Its shape is independent of the population distribution. (correct)
- It has a variance of SE^2 (correct)
- It is centered around the sample mean.
