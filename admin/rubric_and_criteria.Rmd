### Outstanding (82, 88) or Exceptional (95) First 

* Excellent data analysis and presentation
* Correctly executed analysis appropriate to address the research question

* Correctly executed analysis appropriate to address the research question
* Generally coherent presentation that implies a good understanding of visualising, analysing, describing, and interpreting data

* Minor deficiencies in data analysis and presentation
* Analysis partially appropriate to address the research question and/or minor errors in execution

* Moderate deficiencies in data analysis and presentation
* Analysis inappropriate to address the research question and/or errors in execution

### Marginal Fail (35, 38) 

* Serious deficiencies in data analysis and presentation
* Analysis inappropriate to address the research question and/or incorrected executed
* Presentation cursory, incoherent, and/or demonstrates lack of understanding of visualising, analysing, describing, and interpreting data

### Absolute Fail (0, 10, 20, 30) 

* No analysis attempted, or one so ill-concieved as to demonstrate virtually no understanding of visualising, analysing, describing, and interpreting data

\ 

## Critical Thinking

* Critical evaluation of the student's own and other studies' findings
* Discussion of evidence-based criticisms
* Insightful, novel, or theoretically interesting suggestions for future research

### Outstanding (82, 88) or Exceptional (95) First 

* Excellent or high level of ability to criticise constructively both past research and the research that has been performed (both on methodological and theoretical grounds)
* Insightful and worthwhile suggestions for future research

### Clear First (72, 75, 78) 

* Some ability to criticise constructively both past research and the research that has been performed (both on methodological and theoretical grounds)
* Insightful and worthwhile suggestions for future research

### 2.1 (62, 65, 68) 

* Some attempt to criticise constructively their own and past research (both on methodological and theoretical grounds), but these may contain some trivial observations. 
* Sensible suggestions for future research are made

### 2.2 (52, 55, 58) 

* The student has demonstrated a lack of ability to constructively criticise their own or past research (either on methodological or theoretical grounds) or to suggest worthwhile future research.

### 3rd (42, 45, 48) 

* Little evidence of any ability to evaluate the theoretical or methodological limitations of the study performed are presented.

### Marginal Fail (35, 38) 

* There is no evidence of any ability to evaluate the theoretical or methodological limitations of the study performed.

### Absolute Fail (0, 10, 20, 30) 

No attempt to evaluate the theoretical or methodological limitations of the study has been performed.

\ 

## Theoretical Understanding

* Knowledge and understanding of both the research question and the outstanding or key issues in the field
* Understanding of what the results means and their theoretical implications

### Outstanding (82, 88) or Exceptional (95) First 

* The discussion show an excellent understanding of the theoretical issues underlying the research. 
* The discussion demonstrates an insightful grasp of the theoretical implications of the work.

### Clear First (72, 75, 78) 

* Reasonable understanding of theoretical and methodological issues. 
* The discussion shows a good understanding of the theoretical issues underlying the research.

### 2.1 (62, 65, 68) 

* The discussion includes a competent attempt to relate the findings to previous theoretical and empirical research. 
* However, the exposition of theoretical implications is less than in higher bands.

### 2.2 (52, 55, 58) 

* A limited attempt to relate the study to previous work (theoretical and empirical) was made.

### 3rd (42, 45, 48) 

* Little attempt to relate the results to relevant theoretical background material is apparent.

### Marginal Fail (35, 38) 

* There is a complete lack of theoretical insight.

### Absolute Fail (0, 10, 20, 30) 

* There is a complete lack of theoretical insight.

\ 

## Organisation

* Quality of writing
* Clear and scientific communication; clear, error-free, efficient R code
* RMarkdown is a consistently and correctly formatted document
* Organisation into clearly defined and informative sections
* Overall logical and narrative flow of concepts and argument

### Outstanding (82, 88) or Exceptional (95) First 

* Outstanding study and write-up that shows initiative, flair, and originality. 
* The write-up is exceptional in terms of clarity and organisation of material, with little evidence of wandering off on tangents.
* Few or no errors in format conventions.

### Clear First (72, 75, 78) 

* The write-up is well organised and clearly written. 
* The discussion may be slightly less focused than for higher marking bands but largely avoids mentioning work not directly relevant to the current research. 
* There can be minor errors in terms of adherence to project format conventions.

### 2.1 (62, 65, 68) 

* The write-up is fairly well organised and clearly written (possibly with some minor lapses of clarity).
* The discussion may not be as focused as in higher marking bands but the key relevant material is included.
* Some errors in adherence to project format guidelines will be tolerated.

### 2.2 (52, 55, 58)

* Adequately organised and moderately competent project
* Some of the following limitations: lack of adherence to standard format, poor organisation of material, poor or clumsy expression.

### 3rd (42, 45, 48) 

* Basic information about the research is communicated, but there is little attention to comprehensiveness or clarity in describing the procedures used or the results obtained.
* Presentation is somewhat scrappy.

### Marginal Fail (35, 38) 

* Incomplete or badly written up. 
* Very little effort has been put into describing the method, results and relevant background theory and research. 
* There is incoherence in presentation of background material, procedures, or analysis.

### Absolute Fail (0, 10, 20, 30) 

* There is barely any attempt to mention relevant background theory and research, and to describe the method and results.

\ 

## Research

* Sensible and evidence-based design
* Clear and detailed explanation of experimental design and variables
* Breadth and depth of reading
* Application of readings to ideas and interpretation

### Outstanding (82, 88) or Exceptional (95) First 

* Evidence of independent reading of relevant research (from up-to-date journal articles and books). 
* The design is very good in terms of originality, methodological rigour, and theoretical significance.

### Clear First (72, 75, 78) 

* Evidence of some independent reading of relevant research (from up-to date-journalarticles and books), supplementing references already provided on the reading list. 
* The design is good in terms of originality, methodological rigour and theoretical significance.

### 2.1 (62, 65, 68) 

* Background material used for the introduction and discussion does not go substantially beyond that mentioned on the reading list. 
* A competently designed and methodologically rigorous study.

### 2.2 (52, 55, 58) 

* Background material used for the discussion is limited to the reading list.
* The design is adequate in terms of methodological rigour. 

### 3rd (42, 45, 48) 

* The design has some merit but has major methodological flaws or limitations that could have been foreseen and avoided.

### Marginal Fail (35, 38) 

* The design is inadequate to address the research issue.

### Absolute Fail (0, 10, 20, 30) 

* Either no study was conducted or it was so poorly conceived as to be of no consequence whatsoever for the research issue.
