* Main ideas and requirements
* Tour of the lab report Markdown file and data
* What to include in each section
* How to write a discussion
* How the report will be marked

## Asking Questions

* Please go to [pollev.com/drmankin](https://pollev.com/drmankin) and ask your questions there, or upvote other people's questions
* If I run out of time, I will post answers on the Discussion board

# Main Ideas

* Imagine you have tried to **replicate** either the Red or Green study (your choice)
  + Same experiment design and materials/stimuli, same type of data
  + Recruited different people to participate
* Research question: is the red/green effect replicable? 
  + Does it really exist?
  + How do your results compare to the original study?
  + What does this tell you about how people experience attraction, or how they decide what to buy?

## Main Ideas

* Second half of a report **only**
  + Methods, results, discussion, references
  + NO abstract or introduction
* You **must** use the data we give you!
  + Do not need to use or collect any data for or even mention the study you designed for PaaS

## Requirements

* Download [the report Markdown posted on Canvas](https://canvas.sussex.ac.uk/courses/9242/pages/Lab%20Report%20Information%20and%20Resources?titleize=0#creating)
* Edit, customise, and complete this document so that, **when knitted**, it produces a professional report no longer than 2000 words
* Submit the Markdown file on Canvas

### Details

* Formatting: Professional (i.e. like a report/journal article)
  + Consistent and sensible throughout
  + Colour in figures okay, but be reasonable
* APA style?
  + Reporting statistics, citations/references: YES
  + Headings, text formatting, etc.: NO

# Tour of the Markdown file

# What to Include

* Detailed instructions on [the Lab Report page on Canvas](https://canvas.sussex.ac.uk/courses/9242/pages/Lab%20Report%20Information%20and%20Resources?titleize=0#details)
* Methods
* Results
* Discussion
* References

## Methods

* A short participant description
* A succinct description of the variables and design

### Participants

Complete this section by including:

* The number of people who participated in the experiment initially
* The mean, standard deviation, and range of the participants' ages
* How many people you removed, and for what reason(s)
* The final number of people whose data was included in your results
* A table of participant descriptives by experimental condition

### Design

Complete this section by including:

* A statement of the conceptual hypothesis/research question
* A description of the operationalisation of each variable, including:
  + Whether each variable was a factor, a rating, etc.
  + How each variable was measured, such as the levels (for factors) or range of possible scores (for ratings)
  + How to interpret each variable, such as what a high/low score means
* A clear and simple statement of the operational hypothesis
* What statistical analysis you will do to test this hypothesis

## Results

* Describe any changes or transformations of the data
* Report and interpret the general pattern of results

### Red Study Results

* Describe any changes or transformations of the data
  + Mention the **composite score** and how it was calculated
* Report and interpret the general pattern of results
  + Means and SDs in each group, and what they mean
* Report and interpret the results of the statistical test  
  + Independent measures *t*-test as in [the tutorial/practical in Week 7](https://canvas.sussex.ac.uk/courses/9242/pages/week-7)
* Include a figure that illustrates the effect of interest

### Red Study Figures

* Must represent the means and confidence intervals in each group
* Clearly and informatively labeled and coloured

#### Good Example: Colour

#### BAD Example

DO NOT USE BARS

### Green Study Results

* Describe any changes or transformations of the data
  + May not be necessary...
* Report and interpret the general pattern of results
  + Counts or percentage responses in each combination of categories, and what they mean
* Report and interpret the results of the statistical test  
  + Chi-squared test as in [the tutorial/practical for Week 7](https://canvas.sussex.ac.uk/courses/9242/pages/week-6)
* Include a figure that illustrates the effect of interest

### Green Study Figures

Must represent the counts (or percentages) in each combination of categories

## Discussion

* A thorough exploration of what your results mean:
  + For your research question
  + In relation to the research field/future studies
* Should comprise at least half of the words in your report!
* More tips in just a moment

## References

* Formatted list of all of the references you cite in your report
  + Conform to [APA guidelines](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/apa_style/apa_formatting_and_style_guide/reference_list_basic_rules.html)
  + Use other resources (Google Scholar, Zotero, Mendeley, etc.) to help you build the reference list

# Writing Discussions

A good discussion includes the following elements:

* Summary
* Implications
* Limitations
* Future Research
* Conclusion

## Summary

* A summary of the main results in non-statistical language
  + Restate the research question
  + Explain how your statistical result answered the question
* You should be able to skip straight to this section (without reading the results) and still understand it!

## Implications

* A comparison between your results and other studies
  + Did you find the same pattern of results? What does this mean?
  + Did you find a different pattern of results? What does this mean?
* You **must** refer to evidence!
  + Describe and cite related studies

## Limitations

* An analysis of how any problems with the data/design/model/analysis have limited your findings
* Be specific - do not speculate!
  + Good: "Because of X, we found that our participants did Y, which means we are unable to comment on Q..."
  + Bad: "Our participants may have been bored so it could be that none of our results mean anything"
  + Also bad: "The study was not ecologically valid so the results are meaningless"

## Future Research

* Concrete, actionable suggestions for future studies, based on your own findings
  + Concrete: make specific suggestions with reference to evidence
  + Actionable: Realistic - someone could use your suggestion as the research question for their own study
  + Good: "Future studies may want to use a different rating scale, for example the one developed by Author et al. (year), to avoid X problem..."
  + Bad: "Future studies should investigate more options for different conditions."
* You **must** refer to evidence!
  + Describe and cite related studies

## Conclusion

* A short paragraph recapping the main points: research question, result, main implications and next steps

## Discussion Summary

* Examine your results from every angle
  + What you **can** learn from your study
  + What you **can't** learn (but would be good to know!)
* Cite evidence from other papers or your own data
* More resources: [Details on Discussions](https://canvas.sussex.ac.uk/courses/9242/pages/lab-report-information-and-resources#discussion) and [How to Get a First](https://canvas.sussex.ac.uk/courses/9242/pages/how-to-get-a-first)
* Read other papers and use them as examples!
